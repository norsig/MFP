## Installation
This is a typical Ruby on Rails project and it is installed just like any other RoR
project.  Since most of the development/testing is done on Debian & Ubuntu, it 
will be simpler to get up and running if you are using one of those OSs.  However,
it should run on any system that runs Rails.

- Get the [source code](http://github.com/rnhurt/mfp/tree/master)
- Run `bundle install` to install all the dependencies
- Modify `database.yml` to point to your database
- Run `rake db:migrate` to create the database schema
- Run `rake db:seed` to load the seed data
- Run `rails server` to start the development web server
